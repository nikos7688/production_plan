powerplant coding challenge

You will find attached a .rar file with my solution to the challenge. It contains 4 files
a) the python code named energy_plan.py 
b) requirements.txt to install all needed dependencies
c) README.md explaining how the application is launched, how the algorithm is working, and how I tested the application
d) a printscreen demonstrating the testing of the application.
